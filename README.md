# Game Plan

Our main plan is to collect **high-quality learning materials** in the same place in a well-structured manner. All goodies for golang are welcome for PRs. Also, we will give you free NFTs for staring this repo. You can go and check for [GLL website](https://golearningland.com/). If you hate NFTs that is fine; we will give NFTs as a symbol of a community badge do not worry and do not hate us.

### How to mint GLL NFTs?

<div align="center"><p><img src="https://github.com/Go-Learning-Land/Go-Learning-Archive/blob/main/img/mintGopher.png"  /></p></center></div>

1. Wait for minting state. Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GoLearningLand)
2. Go to [GLL website](https://golearningland.com) and click on mint button shown in image.
3. Use your Metamask wallet for pay gas fees. See more information on [Metamask website](https://metamask.io/)

### [Build an Orchestrator in Go](https://www.manning.com/books/build-an-orchestrator-in-go)

<img src="https://images.manning.com/360/480/resize/book/d/d1322d1-6dff-4475-9f70-fba20aef2281/Boring-OS-MEAP-HI.png" width="120px"/>

Understand Kubernetes and other orchestration systems deeply by building your own using Go and the Docker API. 

Orchestration systems like Kubernetes coordinate other software subsystems and services to create a complete organized system. Although orchestration tools have a reputation for complexity, they’re designed around few important patterns that apply across many aspects of software development. Build an Orchestrator in Go reveals the inner workings of orchestration frameworks by guiding you as you design and implement your own using the Go SDK. As you create your own orchestration framework, you’ll improve your understanding of Kubernetes and its role in distributed system design. You’ll also build the skills required to design custom orchestration solutions for those times when an out-of-the-box solution isn’t a good fit.
