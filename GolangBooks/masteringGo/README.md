Source code for Mastering Go, 3rd edition book.

Go is a modern, generic-purpose, open source programming language that was officially announced at the end of 2009. Go began as an internal Google project, which means that it was started as an experiment, and has since been inspired by many other programming languages, including *C*, *Pascal*, *Alef*, and *Oberon*. Go's spiritual fathers are the professional programmers ``Robert Griesemer``, ``Ken Thomson``, and ``Rob Pike``.

Mastering Go, 3rd Edition explores the capabilities of Go *in practice*. You are going to become confident with advanced Go concepts, including concurrency and the operation of the *Go Garbage Collector*, using Go with Docker, writing powerful command line utilities, working with JSON data, and interacting with databases. You are also going to improve your understanding of Go internals to optimize Go code and use data types and data structures in new and unexpected ways. This book also covers the nuances and idioms of Go with exercises and resources to fully embed your newly acquired knowledge. Become an expert Go programmer by building Go projects, writing system utilities and implementing advanced Go techniques in your projects.
